# Crown Cup FaceIT integration

A simple site that connects an org to the FaceIT API to display match data for casters and during streams.
Made with Overwatch 2 in mind.

## Howto

Requires the use of https://docs.faceit.com/docs/data-api/
Set up an APP with your FaceIT-account and add credentials to the config.json file
Find the ID of the org you want to fetch data for, and add that to the config.json file

Preferrably adapt styling and visuals with your own.

Have fun =)
